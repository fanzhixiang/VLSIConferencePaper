\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Among many kinds of one-dimensional nanostructure, silicon nanowire(SiNW) has been highly interested in for its feasibility to be integrated into electronic devices.
Many researches of fabrications and electrical properties have been done \cite{J1}.
And since the first time it was introduced to the biosensor field in 2001\cite{J2}, a promising candidate for ultra-sensitive, real-time and label-free  sensor device it became.
While some great advances on device design were made\cite{J3}, works of systems-level engineering of devices is still insufficient.
In this work, a read-out circuit based on “constant current” idea is proposed.
Some post-simulation results are showed.



\section{Design Concept}
\label{sec:rules}

Conventionally, nanowire is treated as a simple resistance.
The read out circuits are targeted on ultra-low current variance measurement [4] or large resistance detecting range [5,6].
In this work, nanowire is treated as a complete field-effect transistor(FET).
The gate *end* is taken into consider.
And the read out circuit is design for measuring the variance of current, or more specifically: finding out the transconductance of nanowire that changes with analytics concentration.
